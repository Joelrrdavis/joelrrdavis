        <h2>Redesigning for an AI Future</h2>
        <p>
          Adopting artificial intelligence is not a software upgrade — it is an institutional redesign. Off-the-shelf solutions offer efficiency gains, but they rarely confer lasting strategic advantage. In competitive sectors such as telecom and aviation, any early cost savings are quickly commoditized, passed through to consumers. The harder—and more enduring—challenge is integrating AI into the core of how organizations operate and make decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet most firms are structurally unprepared for this shift. HR, legal, and finance departments often resist the introduction of technologies that displace traditional roles. Without deliberate transformation, AI remains a bolt-on tool, not a strategic capability. My consulting work exists in this gap — helping organizations architect the cultural, operational, and strategic frameworks required to leverage AI as a source of differentiation and value creation.

        <h2>What I Offer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>AI Strategy:</strong> Executive-level guidance on aligning AI capabilities with business objectives, resource allocation, and long-term positioning.</li>
          <li><strong>AI Education:</strong> Custom programs and workshops to build AI literacy for leaders, boards, and faculty—bridging technical potential with organizational relevance.</li>
          <li><strong>Adoption Frameworks:</strong> Practical models for responsible and scalable AI integration, informed by empirical research on trust, implementation, and human-AI interaction.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Who I Work With</h2>
        <p>
          I advise both academic institutions and corporate leaders navigating the transition to AI-enhanced operations and curricula. Engagements range from one-off executive briefings to multi-phase transformation initiatives. I also partner with universities to embed AI education into graduate and executive programs, drawing on my work at the intersection of research and practice.
