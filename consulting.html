            <h2>AI Adoption as Strategic Transformation</h2>

            <p>
                Adopting artificial intelligence is not a matter of procurement—it is a matter of transformation.
                While packaged tools may offer productivity gains, they rarely yield sustained competitive advantage
                unless accompanied by deeper institutional change. Without integration into core decision-making
                structures, AI risks becoming a tactical enhancement rather than a strategic asset.
            </p>

            <p>
                Successful adoption demands more than trust. It requires alignment between AI capabilities and
                organizational goals, clarity around roles and decision rights, and the capacity to interpret,
                implement, and iterate on AI outputs. Resistance is common—not just because people mistrust the system,
                but because the surrounding processes, incentives, and norms are misaligned.
            </p>

            <p>
                My consulting work helps organizations bridge this gap. I work with leaders to design the strategic,
                operational, and cultural frameworks that make AI adoption meaningful and durable. That means building
                trust—but also legitimacy, understanding, and alignment—so AI becomes not an add-on, but a core driver
                of how the organization learns, competes, and evolves.
